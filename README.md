# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

Repository for notes, snippets and projects on NODEs. Includes results after training CNN based networks with diffrent methods on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets accordingly.

## Introduction

Neural ODEs are a method of extending [Residual Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) for smoother gradients and general improvements in training. The original paper [(2018) Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) and later on [ANODE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10298) will be papers cited for their content.

In addition, [Neural ODEs for undergraduate students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13uynuOgbnbAjmbHWo8-DbS-0dlKtdF4T/view?usp=sharing) has a great introduction into the subject of matter while [Towards Understanding Normalization in Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09222) explains new advancements in Normalizing NODEs.
